# SideChannel Geolocation with photo metadata

## To run the demo
Install and run the application in a simulator (Not Recommended, because the demo requires photo capture)

Install and run the application in a physical device (Recommended, it's safe trust me :P ) 

Then:
- Accept permission popup
- In android studio "logcat" tab, apply filter "System.out"
- The console should show "date: longtitude, latitude", those are time and capture location from existing photo
- The application perform a check every 5 seconds, and it prints "checking photos everytime"
- Now, switch to camera app and try to take a photo
- The console should show your current location along with current time.

This demo shows that the malicious application with READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE can get user's historical location.

TODO:
- scan the full public directory (currently it only scan Camera directory)


## Troubleshooting 
- Application installation failed (invalid apk)

Try build/"Clean Projecy"
